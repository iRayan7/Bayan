# Bayan
Connecting volunteers around the globe with Hajj workers to eliminate  communication barriers between them and pilgrims through live video call.

## Inspiration
When we were volunteering in Hajj, we ran into many problems of not being able to understand what were the people who came from all over the world saying. Most of them were lost. So we wanted to give the rest of the world a chance to be able to help the people an Hajj go through it in the most convenient way.

## Challenges We Ran Into
Connecting the users in a live stream.

## What's Next For بيان
It can be expanded to help with other fields, like it can be used to help the nurses diagnosing the patients who come to the medical center, help the pilgrims understand Sheikhs, and many more.
